  "text": "Welcome to The Modern Scholar, where great professors teach you. My name is Brian Keeler, and I'll be your host. Today we begin a course entitled Global Warming, Global Threat. Your instructor is Michael McElroy, Gilbert Butler Professor of Environmental Studies at Harvard University. Professor McElroy received his BA, MA, and PhD from Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 1970, he was named Abbott Lawrence Rotch Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Harvard University, and in 1975, he was made Director of the Center for Earth and Planetary Physics. In 2001, he was further honored by being appointed the Director of the newly constructed Harvard University Center for the Environment. Professor McElroy is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His recently published text, The Atmospheric Environment, provides a comprehensive introduction to the atmosphere while highlighting the changes that have occurred over time and offering a context for the disturbances underway as a consequence of human activity. It serves as the primary text of this course. Of all the issues that face civilization at the dawn of the 21st century, global warming is perhaps the most alarming. Scientific evidence shows that in the brief span of time since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, human beings have been significantly changing the Earth's climate. How exactly this will affect our way of life is still a subject that is hotly debated. But many indications show that the results could be disastrous, not only for humans but for all life on Earth. In this course, we'll explore the complex interdependent systems that regulate the Earth's environment as we examine exactly how human activity is influencing them. We'll investigate and define the key issues in the global warming debate as Professor McElroy guides us through intricate scientific concepts as well as explains the reaction of the world community. This rigorous inquiry will lead us to a comprehensive understanding of the science behind the global warming crisis, as well as a deeper understanding of the potential impact it could have on our lives in the not-too-distant future. While you will certainly learn a great deal by listening to Professor McElroy's lectures, you'll get the most out of this course if you pursue the additional studies outlined in the accompanying course guide. Here you'll find recommended readings, illustrations, and short essays. In addition, by visiting this course's webpage at www.modernscholar.com, you'll have access to the most up-to-date information about this course, including links to related sites, a seminar room to share your thoughts with other students, and yes, of course, a final exam. And now we begin Global Warming, Global Threat. Lecture 1: Perspectives on Earth History. And now, Professor McElroy. Welcome to this, the first of 14 lectures on the topic of global warming. The issue of global warming has captured the attention of people worldwide over the past 20 years or so. What is the issue? Well, the issue is that scientists looking at what humans are doing to the global environment today believe that we are changing the climate of the planet on a global basis. We are warming the Earth. Now if you think of the Earth the way you might think of a human body, the human body lives at a relatively constant temperature, 98 degrees or so. If our temperature goes up a little bit, we're sick. If our temperature goes up more than 4 or 5 degrees, we run the risk of dying. So the issue in some sense is, are we changing the health of our planet? Are we causing the climate to change? Is the Earth warming up? And what are the consequences? Global average temperature, people have focused on that as the issue, but of course it's more complicated than that. We need to have a real sense of where the changes are going to occur. Are we going to see rain where it did not occur in the past? Are we going to see drought in regions where there is no drought today? And what is ultimately going to be the effect on people and the effect on plants and the effect on animals and the effect on the entire, if you want to think of it as a human body, the entire body human on a global scale. That's, no less than that is the issue. It's an extremely complicated issue. It has complex scientific dimensions. It involves how the atmosphere and the ocean combine as a system. It involves how the atmosphere, ocean, and life on a global basis interact. And we want to talk a little bit about how that takes place in order to provide this very broad context for understanding the problem of global warming as, as we need to understand it today in order to decide what we should do about it. Now, a few years ago, a famous scientist called Roger Revelle described this issue in rather graphic terms. He said, we are embarked on a global geophysical experiment. We are literally embarked on an experiment in which we have determined that we're going to change the composition of the atmosphere of the Earth on a global basis, and we're going to watch what happens. But we don't know what the outcome of the experiment is. Now, this is a very tricky experiment. Normally, if a scientist does an experiment in the laboratory and it doesn't work out, you scrap the experiment and you do it again, or you change the conditions. But you only have one Earth, so we are engaged today in an experiment, the consequences of which are still somewhat unpredictable.. And Roger Revelle rather graphically caught that particular idea when he first introduced the idea of the global experiment that we're talking about in the context of global warming. Now what are we going to— what's the game plan for these lectures? How are we going to try to do this? Well, I thought it'd be useful in this first lecture to provide a context in which to view the human presence. We need to have a sense of where we are on the stage of life. We need to have a sense of how recent our arrival is. There are many who intuitively, looking at what humans do to the Earth, say, \"This is a very large planet. There's lots of diversity. There's an ocean. There's land. There's forest. There's grassland. How can a few human beings change this planet?\" So we need the context of where we are on the Earth. Are we significant or are we insignificant? How did the Earth get to where it is today? So I'm going to spend some time in this first lecture trying to provide that context, the context in which we see where we are in the scheme of life. Now, after we do that, I want to explicitly begin to discuss in Lecture 2 the concept of the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is basically the phenomenon that maintains the surface of the Earth at a temperature that is hospitable to life, and we'll discuss what that greenhouse effect is. Why is it called the greenhouse effect? Well, there's a loose analogy to the glasshouse or the greenhouse in which in the glasshouse or greenhouse sunlight penetrates the glass to the inside, but the heat is more or less trapped to the interior. The glass does not allow heat to radiate as easily to the outside as it would in the absence of the glass, And so the temperature inside the greenhouse is significantly warmer than it is outside, and so you can grow warm, warm temperature plants in an environment that would otherwise be impossible. So that's basically where the term greenhouse comes from, but we'll explain how that works in the context of the climate system. The other point here is that we need to understand what are the elements that contribute to the greenhouse effect. So we'll be talking about how efficient is the natural greenhouse effect, We need to understand how that works so that we have a better sense of how we are beginning to change it, how— what our impact is in changing it. And what we'll be seeing specifically here is that the gases that are part of the greenhouse effect are relatively few in number. And paradoxically, the major components of the atmosphere, oxygen and nitrogen, are not contributors to the greenhouse. What we'll talk about is that if all we had in the atmosphere was oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and frankly, That's most of what we have. 99% of the Earth on a typical day is made only of these two molecules. If that's all we had, there would be no greenhouse and the Earth would be freezing cold from equator to pole. Life as we know it under those circumstances would not be possible. So it's minor gases in the atmosphere like water vapor, like carbon dioxide, like nitrous oxide, like methane that are the key players in determining the greenhouse effect and ultimately then the average temperature and the climate of the Earth. And that's the context in which we need to understand what we are doing to change the nature of the global greenhouse. We are specifically in this course interested in trying to understand whether human beings are changing global climate. Now, what we'll see in Lecture 3 is that the world in a real sense changed a couple hundred years ago, 100, 250 years ago, during the Industrial Revolution. Up to that point, we were to some extent dependent on nature, but after the Industrial Revolution and our ability to begin to use fossil fuels—coal and oil and gas—and to build machines and to substitute mechanical labor for human and animal labor, suddenly we were effectively free to change the environment in a fashion that we could not before.. And we'll talk about the issues that resulted from the Industrial Revolution and the problems that we have had to grapple with over time. In brief, those are problems that perhaps at least the older people listening to this will be familiar with: the problem of dirty air in cities, the problem of acid rain, the problem of urban smog, and then finally this composite problem, the granddaddy of them all, the problem of global warming.. And so we'll attempt to place this in that context. Now, in dealing with global warming, of course, we need to understand what that means. What is causing global warming? And in doing that, we need to understand what is it that determines the average temperature of the Earth. If we're warming the average temperature of the Earth, what would it be in our— in the absence of our activity, of our influence? So what is it that does it? In Lecture 6, we'll begin to talk about a very important greenhouse gas that is changing, namely carbon dioxide. What is carbon dioxide? Carbon dioxide is the end product of burning coal, oil, and natural gas, and it is accumulating in the atmosphere. The concentration of carbon dioxide is increasing, and it is a critically important greenhouse gas. I will talk about how carbon dioxide changed in the past. I will give you a sense of what the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been over the past 450,000 years of Earth history, and we'll talk about how we know that. And what we'll see at that point is that what's happening right now is effectively unprecedented. The level of carbon dioxide is on a vertical climb, and we are responsible for that change, and we'll talk about how we are doing it and what the prospects are for the future. Having talked about carbon dioxide and what we think is going to happen in Lectures 6 and Lecture 7, Then we'll turn attention to the other greenhouse gases and in particular to the importance of methane and nitrous oxide. What are these gases? Where do they come from? What determines their presence in the atmosphere? How are we changing them? What do we know about the history? Are they part of the problem? What are the activities that humans are responsible for that contribute to their change? We'll see that there are very rapid, again effectively unprecedented changes in the abundance of concentration of these gases occurring globally over the past beginning over the past couple hundred years, effectively since humans began to become a global presence with the Industrial Revolution. At that point, we'll have a real sense of the changes that are taking place in the composition of the atmosphere. And there's no controversy here. The story here is straightforward. Even the most skeptical person who does not believe in environmental issues and wants to run away from it has to admit that the material up to this point is absolutely straightforward. Humans are changing the composition of the atmosphere globally We know that and we have a pretty good idea how we're doing it, why we're doing it, and what the future is likely to be unless we change the way in which we're doing things. But of course the really big issue is, so what? If we're changing the composition of the atmosphere, is that going to affect the climate? How is it going to affect the climate? How do we think about the climate system? How do we think about how it responds to changes in the composition of these greenhouse gases? What we're going to see is that the only significant energy source that keeps the Earth functioning at the— at its surface is the Sun. There is more sunlight absorbed at low latitudes than is radiated out to space in the infrared. So essentially the heat engine that runs the terrestrial climate system is the tropics. And we'll see then about how is it that energy is able to be transferred from the tropics to the subtropics and from there to higher latitudes. So we need to get a sense of the total climate system how it works, how we might be involved currently in changing it, because ultimately that is the issue. At latitudes of about 20 degrees around the world, you find what? You find deserts. The Sahara Desert. Why is it that we have deserts at 20 degrees or so latitude around the world? Are those deserts going to stick there? Could they move? Imagine the Sahara Desert moving into southern Europe, and imagine what the consequences would be for people who live in southern Europe. Imagine the Mojave Desert moving into Iowa or Kansas. What it would do for farm production in the United States. Those are the critical issues that we need to begin to talk about. So we'll talk about why is it that we have deserts where we see them today. Climate system is not just a matter of worrying about the atmosphere, also got to worry about the ocean. The ocean plays a very important role in determining the kind of climate we have on the Earth. So we'll talk about how the ocean functions as a system. How does it play a role in determining the climate that we have today. For example, everybody who lives in North America or who lives in Europe knows about the Gulf Stream. Everybody in North America, particularly the East Coast of North America and in Europe, is aware that the Gulf Stream plays an important role in carrying warm water across the Atlantic and contributing to the relatively mild winters that you find in Northern Europe. Well, why is the Gulf Stream there? Was it always there? Can it change in the future? How does it respond to so-called global warming? What are the implications? We need to understand the ocean as well as the atmosphere. That's part of this grand story of what is happening on the Earth. If you try to assess the significance of the changes in climate that are taking place today, you obviously need to have a sense of history. If I'm a skeptic, I might look at the fact that the Earth is getting a little warmer today and say, ah, it's just a natural phenomenon. The Earth is always changing. The climate is changing. The weather is changing. So I need to have a sense of history. So we'll spend some time talking about the climate of the past. How has the climate of the Earth varied over time? We'll then turn our attention to what, what's likely to happen in the future. What's happening right now to the climate system? What's likely to happen in the future? Why do we care? And having done that, we've essentially posed the problem. Then we get to the important aspects of the policy— dimensions here. What is society going to do about it? What has society done about it? And we'll talk about topics that everybody has heard about, like the Kyoto Protocol and the politics relating to the Kyoto Protocol and the steps that have and have not been taken to deal with the climate problem. So that's a general outline of what we want to do in this course of 14 lectures. And to come back to the target for Lecture 1, What I'd like to do in this lecture is to essentially set the human presence in this large planetary context. So let me give you a brief history of the Earth and a brief history of life on the Earth. The Earth begins 4.5 billion years ago. It's formed from a spinning mass of gas and dust that represent the composition of the original solar nebula. From that spinning mass of gas and dust is going to form all of the planets, all of the meteorites, the moon, and the sun that compose our present solar system. How does that happen? To begin with, it's a pretty hot mass of gas and dust, particularly towards, towards the interior. But with time, it begins to cool down and condensation occurs. Elements begin to form structures. And we begin to form particles and we begin to form ultimately the primitive planets and comets and meteorites and the Sun that compose the solar system today. Now if you think about the Earth at the orbit at which the Earth begins to form, think of its, what its early history was like. We don't have a very good record of what the early days of the Earth really— it's not preserved. We can't go to a rock and interrogate the rock to see what was the condition under which that rock formed because the oldest rocks that we can find at the surface of the Earth are older significantly than the formation of the Earth. So what, what do we think things were like? Well, imagine this planet being put together by material that's, that's sort of coagulating at its center. And it gets more or less up to its present size. There's still a lot of debris falling in from the condensing, cooling solar nebula. So it's been bombarded at the surface by cometary material, by meteorites, by all kinds of things. And the surface of this planet is probably composed mostly of liquid water. So we have a planet-wide ocean. We don't have any continents. The material that composes the planet includes radioactive stuff, and radioactive stuff begins to decay, and there's an internal heat source that operates in this, on this protoplanet.. And that internal heat source causes the Earth to begin to turn itself inside out. So material from the interior begins to— you think of primitive volcanoes blasting all over the Earth. Material from the interior begins to come to the surface and it segregates. The lighter elements tend to stay at the surface, the heavier elements sink back. You effectively begin to differentiate the primitive Earth. And this is the way in which you begin to form the continents. The continents represent lighter rocks floating on denser rock underneath, floating on denser mantle material underneath. So it takes time to begin to form the continents. So if you think of that early Earth, the early Earth has an atmosphere, it has an ocean, and through time it begins to develop continents. Now you can, you can find rocks today that have survived for close to 4 billion years. You cannot find any rocks that are older than 4 billion years, possibly because they were not present at that particular time, possibly because they were not preserved. They haven't survived. We haven't been able to find them. But the oldest rocks we look at, some 3.8 billion years old, show clear signs that life was present on the Earth even 3.8 billion years ago.. And that's a remarkable discovery. Where does that life come from? First of all, I should say that the life forms that you find were clearly simple life forms. Organisms that had perhaps single cells. They were not able to do a great deal of things. They, they had a very simple lifestyle. They had simple energy dependence and they didn't live very long. They were simple. We refer to these organisms as prokaryotes, these early life forms. Where did the prokaryotes come from? How did life get to the Earth? Well, frankly, scientists don't really know. There, there are two possibilities. One is that the seeds of life were formed elsewhere in the universe, perhaps even in the outer regions of the primitive solar nebula. And it rained, literally, manna from heaven to provide the seeds for the eventual plethora of life forms that developed on the Earth. That's a possibility. I rather think there's a more likely possibility, which is that it formed in situ on the Earth. And my favorite location for the formation of the first living organisms would be at vents that are erupting hot molten material into the depths of the primitive ocean. Today, if I go out to the mid-ocean ridges, the material that separates the two parts of the Atlantic Ocean, for example, there's a mountain ridge at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. That mountain ridge represents material that's coming up from the interior that's cooling. You found the mountains and spreading out across the ocean as it cools and becomes denser. Scientists a few years ago found that there are in local areas in this mid-ocean ridge incredible vents where hot water, 300 degrees centigrade water, is coming to the surface with sulfur and chemicals and all kinds of material.. They're called black smoky vents. And as this stuff comes out, it begins to condense in the cold ocean water. And you find around these vents a remarkably simple but yet still complex life form that is living off the energy available in the vent material itself. Effectively, these are organisms that are taking sulfur coming out of the vents using oxygen that's present in the water and extracting energy by oxidizing the sulfur to sulfur dioxide or to sulfate in the process, gaining energy and being able to grow. So it is remarkable that today at the hundreds, I mean several kilometers below the surface of the ocean, you find these life forms. My best guess is that this may be where life forms in fact began on the Earth, but we don't really know. What we do know is that the evolution of life was a relatively slow process. And by evolution here I mean the, the transition to more complex life forms. The early life forms were simple unicellular, as I said, prokaryotes. Now through time, life begins to become a little bit more complicated. And we begin to see multicellular organisms develop. They're called eukaryotes. How do these eukaryotes come around? There's a wonderful theory that was advanced maybe 30 years ago by a very talented biologist called Lynn Margulis, currently a professor at the University of Massachusetts. And Lynn Margulis had the interesting idea that one organism might infect another, and effectively they might join their genetic material., so that a composite organism is on the scene with the ability to do at least what these organisms could do separately, and perhaps even more. So the idea here is that genetic complexity develops from essentially infection of one simple organism by another, and so on, and so on, and so on. And that, you know, from the point of view of human experience is not an unexpected idea. After all, We know that we have lots of organisms that live inside our bodies. We know that bacteria play critical roles in determining how we live our lifestyles, and that is a fact of life in nature. So it was an interesting idea, and as time has gone by, the evidence supports that Lynn Margulis had it right. The prokaryotes were the antecedents of these more complex organisms, eukaryotes, that developed somewhat later. The stage of life still is relatively sparse. There's a wonderful record that is preserved in what's called the Burgess Shale that was discovered by geologists a few decades ago. The Burgess Shale has the most incredible complexity of life forms preserved in that sediment, in that ancient sediment, which goes back to about 1.5 billion years ago.. And in that record, 1.5 billion years ago, there is such a complexity of life forms that biologists believe that you can effectively track the antecedents of every organism that's alive today in that particular record. Of course, life changes as evolution continues. So that's where you get to by 1.5 billion years. Now life is not, and evolution is not, as some people believe, a steady Darwinian process where the strong survive and the weak die away. That's not really the way we think about it. It is in fact a process in which evolution occurs almost in steps. There are times of rapid environmental change which leads to rapid change in the type of organisms that can survive it. And so there are winners and losers, but over relatively short periods of time. Biologists would refer to this as punctuated equilibrium. It's not a steady process, but a process that occurs in spurts. And there's spurts of rapid disappearance and appearance of new organism types. Perhaps the best publicized part of this is the story of the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were common on the Earth, a wonderful variety of life forms, big, clumsy, creative creatures that were all over the Earth living in an environment very different from today. Probably an environment where the Earth was actually quite a bit warmer than it is today. Then what happened? Well, as best we can reconstruct it, what happened was that over a relatively brief period of time, the Earth was smacked by a large meteor or by a series of meteors. And these meteors triggered global climate change. The first real evidence for a massive global climate change that had clear implications for some of our genetic ancestors.. And over a relatively short period of time, most of the dinosaurs essentially went extinct. But life continued and new forms developed. That's the context in which we have to think about what we're doing today. Now humans, how, how, at what point do we arrive on the scene of life? You can look at the diversity of genetic material in the humans that are alive today and try to get some sense of how related we all are. And that process says that, you know, whether our skins are black or yellow or white or whatever, we are all the same species and we are very closely related. In fact, very difficult genetically to tell the difference between someone with black skin and someone with white skin. Genetically, we are the same. Tracking that genetic similarity back, the conclusion is that we all had a common maternal ancestor. There was an Eve, and that Eve was around probably about 150,000 years ago and probably lived in East Central Africa is the best choice for where that ancestor of all of us really lived 150,000 years ago. Now, if you track what happens to human beings from 150,000 years ago, our, our early ancestors, Eve's immediate children and grandchildren were probably very simple individuals. They lived very simple lives. But with time, they became more skilled and, and they also became migrant. They started to move and they moved around the world. They moved perhaps initially into the Middle East, and from the Middle East they spread into Europe and into Asia, and eventually they arrived in the Americas. They arrived in the Americas about 50,000 years ago. How did they get to the Americas? Well, 50,000 years ago, the Earth was, was deep in an ice— the last major ice age that it had. Sea level globally was 120 meters, 350 feet or so, lower than it is today. And you could walk from Siberia to Alaska through the Bering Straits. The sea level was low enough so there was a land bridge. So our best thought is that humans, in fact, arrived in the Americas by this slow migratory path 50,000 years ago. Over the early period of human presence in North America, there may, may not have been very many people here, but they certainly did a fair amount of damage. Because when they arrived, this was a planet that was rich in large megafauna. You know, woolly mammoths and things like that were having a fine time living in the Americas.. And over a very short period of time after our human ancestors arrived, they had in fact eliminated many species. So the idea that humans had some real inbuilt respect for nature and were conditioned to do the right thing is probably not supported by the history of life on the planet or the history of our human ancestors on the planet. What we will be concerned with primarily in this set of lectures though is going to be the effect of modern man the global environment, how we have become a global force. And if I were to try to date that global nascence, it would be to point at the Industrial Revolution as the time when this all happened. Industrial Revolution was when man first became liberated essentially from dependence on human and animal labor and began to be able to use machines in a very efficient way, 150, 250 years ago. I've talked about 4.5 billion years of Earth history. 4.5 billion is a big number and it's very hard to get a sense of what this all means. Imagine that we compress the history of the Earth into one year. And so we formed the Earth from the primitive solar nebula on January 1. What are the major events that we've talked about in this lecture? Well, the early life forms were clearly present by the time we find these early rocks. When is that? 17th of February. So we don't know anything about the first January or the first 2 weeks in February. 17th of February, the continents had begun to form and life was apparently present on the planet. It takes almost 7 months, early September, before you start to see the eukaryotes. These more complex organisms begin to appear. So you get a sense that the pace of evolution is rather slow. How about mammals? 18th of December is when the mammals first arrive. And the dinosaurs disappear on the 26th of December. Humans, 9 PM on December 31st, is when our primitive Eve, our ancestral Eve, first arrives on the scene. The Industrial Revolution, that's 2 seconds to midnight on December 31st. And the issue that we're going to be dealing with in this course is what's going to happen over the next few tenths of a second of our history. So that's the sense of the problem that we're going to talk about. Now, in the next lecture, we're actually going to digress. We're going to talk about another environmental issue. This is the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion, which got a lot of attention over the last number of years. And it's an issue that people have personalized often in terms of the Antarctic ozone hole., and many people see the problems as somehow interrelated or maybe even the same problem. But they're not the same problem, but I want to tell this story because in some respects this is an example of a global issue that caught public attention on a global basis where leaders and nations came together with success in dealing with the problem. And it's useful to see it as context for how we might then return to deal with the problem of global climate change or global warming. After this brief digression, we're going to return to our main theme. Specifically, we're going to return to the theme of having a look at how society has lived its life since the Industrial Revolution, and specifically how we have identified late in the game a whole variety of problems associated with our use of fossil fuel ultimately culminating in the big one of all, the problem of climate change and global warming.
