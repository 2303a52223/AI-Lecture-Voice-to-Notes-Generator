# 📝 Study Notes: Global Warming Global Threat 01

## 📋 Summary
Today we begin a course entitled Global Warming, Global Threat. His recently published text, The Atmospheric Environment, provides a comprehensive introduction to the atmosphere while highlighting the changes that have occurred over time and offering a context for the disturbances underway as a consequence of human activity. Scientific evidence shows that in the brief span of time since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, human beings have been significantly changing the Earth's climate. But many indications show that the results could be disastrous, not only for humans but for all life on Earth. In this course, we'll explore the complex interdependent systems that regulate the Earth's environment as we examine exactly how human activity is influencing them. We'll investigate and define the key issues in the global warming debate as Professor McElroy guides us through intricate scientific concepts as well as explains the reaction of the world community. This rigorous inquiry will lead us to a comprehensive understanding of the science behind the global warming crisis, as well as a deeper understanding of the potential impact it could have on our lives in the not-too-distant future. And now we begin Global Warming, Global Threat. The issue of global warming has captured the attention of people worldwide over the past 20 years or so. Well, the issue is that scientists looking at what humans are doing to the global environment today believe that we are changing the climate of the planet on a global basis. Now if you think of the Earth the way you might think of a human body, the human body lives at a relatively constant temperature, 98 degrees or so. Global average temperature, people have focused on that as the issue, but of course it's more complicated than that. And what is ultimately going to be the effect on people and the effect on plants and the effect on animals and the effect on the entire, if you want to think of it as a human body, the entire body human on a global scale. It involves how the atmosphere, ocean, and life on a global basis interact. And we want to talk a little bit about how that takes place in order to provide this very broad context for understanding the problem of global warming as, as we need to understand it today in order to decide what we should do about it. We are literally embarked on an experiment in which we have determined that we're going to change the composition of the atmosphere of the Earth on a global basis, and we're going to watch what happens. But you only have one Earth, so we are engaged today in an experiment, the consequences of which are still somewhat unpredictable.. And Roger Revelle rather graphically caught that particular idea when he first introduced the idea of the global experiment that we're talking about in the context of global warming. There are many who intuitively, looking at what humans do to the Earth, say, "This is a very large planet. So I'm going to spend some time in this first lecture trying to provide that context, the context in which we see where we are in the scheme of life. The greenhouse effect is basically the phenomenon that maintains the surface of the Earth at a temperature that is hospitable to life, and we'll discuss what that greenhouse effect is. The glass does not allow heat to radiate as easily to the outside as it would in the absence of the glass, And so the temperature inside the greenhouse is significantly warmer than it is outside, and so you can grow warm, warm temperature plants in an environment that would otherwise be impossible. So we'll be talking about how efficient is the natural greenhouse effect, We need to understand how that works so that we have a better sense of how we are beginning to change it, how— what our impact is in changing it. If that's all we had, there would be no greenhouse and the Earth would be freezing cold from equator to pole. So it's minor gases in the atmosphere like water vapor, like carbon dioxide, like nitrous oxide, like methane that are the key players in determining the greenhouse effect and ultimately then the average temperature and the climate of the Earth. And that's the context in which we need to understand what we are doing to change the nature of the global greenhouse. We are specifically in this course interested in trying to understand whether human beings are changing global climate. Now, what we'll see in Lecture 3 is that the world in a real sense changed a couple hundred years ago, 100, 250 years ago, during the Industrial Revolution. Up to that point, we were to some extent dependent on nature, but after the Industrial Revolution and our ability to begin to use fossil fuels—coal and oil and gas—and to build machines and to substitute mechanical labor for human and animal labor, suddenly we were effectively free to change the environment in a fashion that we could not before.. And we'll talk about the issues that resulted from the Industrial Revolution and the problems that we have had to grapple with over time. In brief, those are problems that perhaps at least the older people listening to this will be familiar with: the problem of dirty air in cities, the problem of acid rain, the problem of urban smog, and then finally this composite problem, the granddaddy of them all, the problem of global warming.. And so we'll attempt to place this in that context. Now, in dealing with global warming, of course, we need to understand what that means. And in doing that, we need to understand what is it that determines the average temperature of the Earth. If we're warming the average temperature of the Earth, what would it be in our— in the absence of our activity, of our influence? In Lecture 6, we'll begin to talk about a very important greenhouse gas that is changing, namely carbon dioxide. I will give you a sense of what the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been over the past 450,000 years of Earth history, and we'll talk about how we know that. Having talked about carbon dioxide and what we think is going to happen in Lectures 6 and Lecture 7, Then we'll turn attention to the other greenhouse gases and in particular to the importance of methane and nitrous oxide. We'll see that there are very rapid, again effectively unprecedented changes in the abundance of concentration of these gases occurring globally over the past beginning over the past couple hundred years, effectively since humans began to become a global presence with the Industrial Revolution. Humans are changing the composition of the atmosphere globally We know that and we have a pretty good idea how we're doing it, why we're doing it, and what the future is likely to be unless we change the way in which we're doing things. If we're changing the composition of the atmosphere, is that going to affect the climate? What we're going to see is that the only significant energy source that keeps the Earth functioning at the— at its surface is the Sun. So we need to get a sense of the total climate system how it works, how we might be involved currently in changing it, because ultimately that is the issue. The ocean plays a very important role in determining the kind of climate we have on the Earth. If you try to assess the significance of the changes in climate that are taking place today, you obviously need to have a sense of history. If I'm a skeptic, I might look at the fact that the Earth is getting a little warmer today and say, ah, it's just a natural phenomenon. How has the climate of the Earth varied over time? So let me give you a brief history of the Earth and a brief history of life on the Earth. The Earth begins 4.5 billion years ago. And we begin to form particles and we begin to form ultimately the primitive planets and comets and meteorites and the Sun that compose the solar system today. Now if you think about the Earth at the orbit at which the Earth begins to form, think of its, what its early history was like. We can't go to a rock and interrogate the rock to see what was the condition under which that rock formed because the oldest rocks that we can find at the surface of the Earth are older significantly than the formation of the Earth. The material that composes the planet includes radioactive stuff, and radioactive stuff begins to decay, and there's an internal heat source that operates in this, on this protoplanet.. And that internal heat source causes the Earth to begin to turn itself inside out. So material from the interior begins to— you think of primitive volcanoes blasting all over the Earth. So if you think of that early Earth, the early Earth has an atmosphere, it has an ocean, and through time it begins to develop continents. But the oldest rocks we look at, some 3.8 billion years old, show clear signs that life was present on the Earth even 3.8 billion years ago.. And that's a remarkable discovery. First of all, I should say that the life forms that you find were clearly simple life forms. And it rained, literally, manna from heaven to provide the seeds for the eventual plethora of life forms that developed on the Earth. And my favorite location for the formation of the first living organisms would be at vents that are erupting hot molten material into the depths of the primitive ocean. Scientists a few years ago found that there are in local areas in this mid-ocean ridge incredible vents where hot water, 300 degrees centigrade water, is coming to the surface with sulfur and chemicals and all kinds of material.. And you find around these vents a remarkably simple but yet still complex life form that is living off the energy available in the vent material itself. So it is remarkable that today at the hundreds, I mean several kilometers below the surface of the ocean, you find these life forms. My best guess is that this may be where life forms in fact began on the Earth, but we don't really know. The Burgess Shale has the most incredible complexity of life forms preserved in that sediment, in that ancient sediment, which goes back to about 1.5 billion years ago.. And in that record, 1.5 billion years ago, there is such a complexity of life forms that biologists believe that you can effectively track the antecedents of every organism that's alive today in that particular record. Dinosaurs were common on the Earth, a wonderful variety of life forms, big, clumsy, creative creatures that were all over the Earth living in an environment very different from today. Probably an environment where the Earth was actually quite a bit warmer than it is today. Well, as best we can reconstruct it, what happened was that over a relatively brief period of time, the Earth was smacked by a large meteor or by a series of meteors. The first real evidence for a massive global climate change that had clear implications for some of our genetic ancestors.. And over a relatively short period of time, most of the dinosaurs essentially went extinct. You can look at the diversity of genetic material in the humans that are alive today and try to get some sense of how related we all are. There was an Eve, and that Eve was around probably about 150,000 years ago and probably lived in East Central Africa is the best choice for where that ancestor of all of us really lived 150,000 years ago. Now, if you track what happens to human beings from 150,000 years ago, our, our early ancestors, Eve's immediate children and grandchildren were probably very simple individuals. Well, 50,000 years ago, the Earth was, was deep in an ice— the last major ice age that it had. You know, woolly mammoths and things like that were having a fine time living in the Americas.. And over a very short period of time after our human ancestors arrived, they had in fact eliminated many species. So the idea that humans had some real inbuilt respect for nature and were conditioned to do the right thing is probably not supported by the history of life on the planet or the history of our human ancestors on the planet. What we will be concerned with primarily in this set of lectures though is going to be the effect of modern man the global environment, how we have become a global force. And if I were to try to date that global nascence, it would be to point at the Industrial Revolution as the time when this all happened. Industrial Revolution was when man first became liberated essentially from dependence on human and animal labor and began to be able to use machines in a very efficient way, 150, 250 years ago. I've talked about 4.5 billion years of Earth history. Well, the early life forms were clearly present by the time we find these early rocks. And the issue that we're going to be dealing with in this course is what's going to happen over the next few tenths of a second of our history. But they're not the same problem, but I want to tell this story because in some respects this is an example of a global issue that caught public attention on a global basis where leaders and nations came together with success in dealing with the problem. And it's useful to see it as context for how we might then return to deal with the problem of global climate change or global warming. Specifically, we're going to return to the theme of having a look at how society has lived its life since the Industrial Revolution, and specifically how we have identified late in the game a whole variety of problems associated with our use of fossil fuel ultimately culminating in the big one of all, the problem of climate change and global warming.
