# 📝 Study Notes: Discovering the Philosopher in You

## 📋 Summary
Today we begin a course entitled Discovering the Philosopher in You: The Big Questions in Philosophy. Yet the basic questions of philosophy, from logic to ethics, from the human mind to God, have been pondered by people around the world for centuries. Perhaps this is because every human being has their own inner philosopher, a voice within that asks the basic philosophical questions. For surely everyone on some level wants to know what the ultimate nature of the world is, where ethical truth comes from, what the meaning of life is, and whether or not we can really know anything. In the end, our goal is to arrive at a better understanding of these big questions while striving along the way to uncover and exercise the philosopher's mind that lies within each of us. I think that everybody has inside them what I would call their inner philosopher. It's a kind of voice that you have that every now and then presses you to think about certain questions which in your daily life you don't normally think about, what we might think of as abstract or very general questions. So everybody wants to know what the ultimate nature of the world is, what kind of thing reality is. Everybody wants to know what the self is, what their own self is, the thing they refer to when they say 'I.' They want to know whether they have free will. They want to know whether they could act differently from the way they do act, whether they can be praised or blamed. They want to know whether or not they are free agents. They want to know how their minds relate to their bodies. They know they have a mind, they know they have a body. The relationship seems problematic, and they would like to know how these two things, if they are two things, are related to each other. They would also like to know whether they know anything at all. How extensive is their knowledge?— that's the first question which belongs to what's called in philosophy epistemology, the theory of knowledge. Everybody wants to know where ethical truth comes from. Of course, everybody wants to know what the meaning of life is. And of course, everybody wants to know whether there's a God and whether the existence of God can be established rationally or whether it's a matter of faith, whether arguments against the existence of God. So all of these questions, which I think people naturally ask at one time or another, often after they've had a few drinks, these questions are questions which everybody asks. Not everybody, I think, has their inner car salesman or inner paleontologist or even inner historian, because those are much more specialized concerns, but everybody is a person, is a human being, and is confronted with these basic realities and wants to understand them better. So this inner philosopher I talk about is of course related to what we know of, we often describe as the inner child, not in the sense of an immature thing which we shouldn't take any account of, but the inner child meaning the naive view of the universe. So children ask philosophical questions of their parents, much to their exasperation very often, Well, that inner philosopher is just your inner child still asking questions after all these years, and we shouldn't suppress that inner voice. Now, all that's all very well, you might say, but how are we to proceed with our inner voice, our inner philosophical voice? And of course, philosophers have thought about these questions for all these thousands of years, and great minds have been devoted to these questions. So you really need an expert guide who can take you through philosophy and philosophical ideas that have been generated to try to think about these questions. I would advise you as we go along to look at the study guide after each lecture and to go over what I've said, because not everything will be clear the first time around. Well, if you read, of course, you can slow down, think about something you've heard, turn it over in your mind until you think you've understood it, and then go back to it. Whenever I'm teaching my students, I always tell them they need to do two things: they need to show up to the lectures and listen and take notes of the lectures, but they must also read the materials, reread the materials if necessary, and then they'll be prepared for what's coming up later and they'll have a much more rewarding and enjoyable experience in listening to the lectures. So I spoke about the idea that each of us has an inner philosopher inside of us, the voice which asks these questions. But when I reached a certain age, about 18 I suppose it must have been, I had a teacher who taught me divinity at school, and he awakened my interest in these kinds of questions, particularly through considering the existence of God and the states of religion, a topic I'm going to talk about in the very final lecture. But probably almost everybody, when they reach a certain age, is least capable of taking an interest in these questions, so long as the questions are presented to them in a way which is engaging and clear and relevant to them, they can, they can then say, 'Yes, I am interested in that question.' I wish when I was a teenager I would have encountered somebody who would have just put to me in a nice clear form what all the problems are, what's been said, and that would have stimulated me and awakened my interest. But in the course of these lectures, my aim is to put across all the basics of philosophy so that anybody who has an interest awakened in the subject can find their interest satisfied by just listening to these lectures and reading the notes and the readings that go along with them. So, in each lecture I'll take some big problem, some big topic, the self or free will or the mind-body problem, whatever it may be, and I'll discuss that problem within each lecture, hoping each lecture will be relatively self-contained so that by listening to a single lecture you'll get a good sense of what's been said about that problem and what the various positions have been. I wouldn't, I won't always attempt to resolve problems, I'll often leave problems open at the end, questions open at the end of each lecture. Things have been said and clarifications have been made, new theories have been developed, but I wouldn't say that any of these problems have been definitively resolved in the way a scientist may say resolve the question of what the structure of the genes was when, when Watson and Crick discovered the DNA and the double helix. The questions I'm considering here are the age-old questions of philosophy, which have been around as long as human beings have been able to think about philosophy. But there's the question: what is knowledge, and how much do we really know? Most introductions to philosophy do start with the question of what we know, and I will make no exception to that rule. Well, Plato's first point about this is that if that were the case, then they would be radically not in possession of the kind of knowledge which we take ourselves to have. If they were to be conducted out of the cave and shown the bright light of day, they would realize that the world that they lived in was a world of illusion, a world of mere appearances, and that the real world was very different from what they had expected. The appearance of the senses, things we have, those visual experiences, auditory experiences, things look a certain way, Things sound a certain way, things feel a certain way, and as a, as a result of these experiences, we make assumptions about the way the world really is. Obviously, people don't always know what they think they know. They think that they know the date of a certain battle, they get it wrong, and if they're taking an exam, their grade suffers. So most, according to scepticism, most of what we think we know, we don't know. We make mistakes, and we have not an insufficient justification for what it is that we take ourselves to know. What is it that we take ourselves to know which can conceivably be doubted? But how do I know that that is really the case? Well, the first point that Descartes makes about this is a point which I think everybody can identify with, which is this: very often I've had dreams in which I've taken myself to be doing something, or in a certain situation, and of course it's only a dream, and I'm not doing that, I'm not in that situation. So Descartes' question is, how do I know now that I'm not dreaming? So how do I really know that I'm not dreaming now? And the philosophical question raised by the film is, how do we know we're not in the Matrix now? It would be difficult to know what evidence would count towards that. But the problem of Descartes is, how do we know that we're not? Not how do we know that we are, if we are, but how do we know we're not in the Matrix? So the other form of the same question is, how do we know we're not brains in vats? If we were brains in vats, things would seem the same way, to us as they do if we were not brains in vats, so how can we distinguish between the two cases? It's no good the brain in the vat trying to find more and more sensory, sensory experiences to back up its belief that it really is seeing a dog in front of it, or whatever it may be, because it would have those experiences even if it were a brain in a vat. So that is the first kind of scepticism, scepticism about the external world, and it is a very radical and disturbing kind of scepticism. How do we really know that this is the case? Let's take the problem of what's called the problem of other minds. How do I know other people have minds? I think my wife has a mind, I think my friends have minds, I think vast millions and millions of people have minds. And so, given the way that they behave, the things they say, If they're behaving, you know, groaning and moaning and holding a part of their body, you make the assumption that they are in pain. How do I really know that other people have minds and not just a mindless automaton? You might think the answer to this skeptical problem about other minds was, was easy. So the idea would be this: I know that I have a mind. Therefore, I know that you have a mind on the basis of this analogy. How can I justify my belief that just because in my case there's an association between a mind and a body of a certain type, therefore in the case of all the other millions of bodies that are out there There's a similar association between the body and the mind. How do I move from the one case that I have a mind to the idea that every other person with a body has a mind too? Speaking of robots, there's the other question: if you were to have robots, how would you know that they don't have minds? I mean, you've just got— you've got the behavior there, it seems similar to the behavior of humans, Well, we think humans have the minds, the robots don't. How do we really know anything about the mental states of other organisms apart from ourselves? It's something which children— I mentioned children earlier— children will come up with very early on when they say, they ask questions like, how do I know that you see the world in the same colors that I see the world? How do they know— how do I know that other people, when they look at the same object, it looks red to them? So how do I really know what their mental states are? One is, how do I know which mental state somebody else has? And the more radical question, how do I know they have any mental states? It questions our whole common-sense belief about things, and if you were to become convinced by it, it would entirely change your relationship to other people. You would start to think they were zombies, and that might be something that would affect the way you treat them. But there's this question: suppose I can know that I exist, do I know that I exist in the past? Do I know I'll exist into the future? There's a problem here about how do I know about the past and how do I know about the future? The one about the future goes as follows: I've made over the course of my life various observations about the way things behave. I know if I eat bread, I'll be I know that if I touch fire it will burn me. I know a great many— take myself to know a great many things about the way the world behaves. But the skeptic, then, on the basis of that knowledge, I take myself to know how the world will behave in the future. How can I be sure, given what I know about the past, that the future will be the same as the past? Again, the problem is we're inferring that the past exists and has a certain to a certain extent from certain traces of the past in the present. Solipsism of the moment is: the only thing I can know to exist is me right now, not me in the past, not me in the future, not anything apart from me, but only my own present state. Well, implicit in what I've said is that it is apparent, it is apparently a limit, and I would myself think there is a limit to the scepticism, because solipsism of the moment, though it rejects almost everything we take ourselves to know, there is one thing it doesn't reject: my own existence now. I may not know that I've thought anything in the past. Maybe I don't know anything will in the future, and I don't know that the things I think about really exist, but that I am thinking, that's something I really do know, and I can't doubt that. Not only do I know that I'm thinking, but I know that I exist. I don't know I continue through time, but I know I exist now. It may seem like not much given everything that's been lost, but at least it's something that can't be doubted. Now, ever since Descartes promulgated and defended this scepticism, philosophers have been worrying about how to answer the sceptic, and I'm— fear I must tell you that there is no agreed-upon answer to these problems, and I myself don't think there's ever been a satisfactory reply to the sceptic, a convincing proof that we do know all the things that the sceptic did— thinks that we don't know. And so, it may seem that we really don't know the things that we take ourselves to know. They may say, okay, the skeptic has shown that we don't know what we take ourselves to know. We're not certain of the things that we take ourselves to be certain of. This is something which philosophers often don't think about very much, because I think it's plain to most people that they are worried about scepticism. Once you raise a sceptical question, you think you would lose something if scepticism were true and you didn't have all this knowledge that you take yourself to have. Well, this raises the question of the relationship between knowledge and happiness, which we will come back to at the very end. But I want to say something now about why it does matter to us that we don't have the knowledge we think we have. What knowledge gives us is a kind of unification between the self, or consciousness, and the world beyond the self. There's the self and there's the not-self, and when we have knowledge We take ourselves to be in possession of the truth, and thereby there is a kind of bridge or link between us as a knowing consciousness and the world outside of us. Any inference beyond our current state of consciousness is something highly questionable and shouldn't be made, and really we're not entitled to make any such inference from our state of consciousness. This is radically contrary to the way I think we normally, commonsensically think about our consciousness. When I see something in front of me, like the bottle of water I have in front of me now, I take my mind to be linked to something in the external world, and there to be a unification of me with the external world. It seems like an alarming consequence because we thought that consciousness was something which could take us beyond ourselves. It could enlarge the self, it could make the self more than just this momentary passing Experience is something which engages me with the world and makes me join to things beyond me. Now, so we have now discussed the question of what do we know, and the problems of establishing what we know and how much we know.
